# CSharp-TCP-app
C# application for TCP communication with known server.

## How it works
Once open, you have two choices: client or server side.

On the cliente side you need to provide the server IP address and the port the server is listening to, and then hit the button on the bottom of the screen (which will conect to the server).

On the server side, you just need to enter a port to listen to and hit the button ... (same as above), which will start the server.

That's just it. No messages or anything. Just connect to the server ... for nothing. :unamused:

*PS: Both the server and client side must be in the same network.*
